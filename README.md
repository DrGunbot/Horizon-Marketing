**Welcome to our first project! We were assigned the task of fixing an existing website to meet the following requirements:**

1. Semantic HTML elements were used throughout the source code
2. HTML elements followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
3. Image and icon elements contained accessible alt attributes
4. Heading attributes fell in sequential order
5. Title elements contained a concise, descriptive title  

*** I worked hard to ensure that all of these requirements were met.  
*** I also added some extra features to keep the company happy. It is responsive to screen size - and they year in the footer will dynamically change.  
*** We hope you enjoy the improved website. Thank you for taking the time to check it out!
